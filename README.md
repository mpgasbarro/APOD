# Project2 Proposal 

## Project Description 

My app is called Astronomy Picture of the Day or APOD, for short. It is an Astronomy app, that generates a random image that relates to Astronomy, from around the world. With each image, the app will provide a brief description of its significance and an explanation of what you are viewing. Users can select previous APOD's from the previous days or they can search specific dates.

## User Stories

#### MVP Goals

- As a user, I want to see the APOD, with a description of what I am viewing and other relevant information.

- As a user, I want to be able to look up specific dates, to see what the APOD was, for that specific day.

- As a user, I want to be able to be able to easily navigate the screen, without getting confused. 

#### Stretch Goals

- As a developer, I want to create a more dynamic search functionality, so that if you're interested in seeing a specific event, you can search for those specific pictures.

- As a developer, I want to incorporate a secondary API, that provides realtime images of earth.

      "description":"What does an aurora look like to a frog? \"Awesome!\" is the likely answer, suggested by this imaginative snapshot taken on October 3rd from Kiruna, Sweden. Frequented by apparitions of the northern lights, Kiruna is located in Lapland north of the Arctic Circle, and often under the auroral oval surrounding planet Earth's geomagnetic north pole. To create a tantalizing view from a frog's perspective the photographer turned on the flashlight on her phone and placed it on the ground facing down, resting her camera's lens on top. The \"diamonds\" in the foreground are icy pebbles right in front of the lens, lit up by the flashlight. Reflecting the shimmering northern lights, the \"lake\" is a frozen puddle on the ground. Of course, in the distance is the Bengt Hultqvist Observatory.",
